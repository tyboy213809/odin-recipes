    <h1>Homemade Smash Burgers</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <P>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with 
    crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for 
    best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer 
    to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. 
    These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make 
    ure you have everything ready to go!</P>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>4 hamburger buns</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</p>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</p>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>salt to taste</p>
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>4 slices American cheese</p>
            <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
        <p>burger toppings of choice</p>
    </ul>



        
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>

            <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
    Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron 
    skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>

            <p>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>

            <p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>

            <p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</p>
